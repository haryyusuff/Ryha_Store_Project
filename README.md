# Ryha_Store_Project

This project involves developing a dashboard using real data from my small retail footwear business. To understand our business process, you can read the company profile in the attached PDF file. Although I attempted to upload the dashboard via the Power BI service for easy access, my account has a limited license. Instead, you can access the dashboard by opening the .pbix file on your local device. I hope you find insightful information and enjoy it.
